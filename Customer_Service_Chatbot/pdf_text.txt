Performance varies by use, configuration, and other factors. Learn more on the Performance Index site.
Performance results are based on testing as of dates shown in configurations and may not reflect all publicly available updates. See backup for configuration details. No product or 
component can be absolutely secure.
Your costs and results may vary.
Intel technologies may require enabled hardware, software, or service activation.

1. Select SKUs E-cores frequency improved. See ark.intel.com for SKU details.
2. Subject to regional availability, operating system support and router compatibility. Learn more at https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/products/docs/wireless/wi-fi-7.html 
3. On select processor SKUs. DDR5-5600 MT/s 1DPC UDIMM 1Rx8, 1Rx16 (lead supplier) and DDR5-5200 1Rx8, 1Rx16, 2Rx8 are POR on all Intel® Core™ i9 desktop processor SKUs, all 

Intel® Core™ i7 desktop processor SKUs, and select Intel® Core™ i5 desktop processor SKUs (14th gen).

4. Check motherboard vendor for compatible BIOS. 
5.
6. Performance hybrid architecture combines two core microarchitectures, Performance-cores (P-cores) and Efficient-cores (E-cores), on a single processor die first introduced on 

Intel® Core™ i5 desktop processors (14th gen), Intel® Core™ i7 desktop processors (14th gen), and Intel® Core™ i9 desktop processors (14th gen) only.

12th Gen Intel® Core™ processors. Select 12th Gen and newer Intel® Core™ processors do not have performance hybrid architecture, only P-cores, and have same cache size as prior 
generation. Intel® Core™ i3 N-series processors only have E-cores. See ark.intel.com for SKU details.

7. Built into the hardware, Intel® Thread Director is provided only in performance hybrid architecture configurations of 12th Gen or newer Intel® Core™ processors; OS enablement is 

required. Available features and functionality vary by OS.

8. Processor cores listed first are the total number of cores in the processor followed by the number of P-cores and E-cores in parentheses (P+E).
9.
10. Efficient-core frequencies are lower to optimize power usage. The frequency of cores and core types varies by workload, power consumption, and other factors. Visit 

Intel® Hyper-Threading Technology, Intel® Turbo Boost Max Technology 3.0, and Intel® Thermal Velocity Boost are only available on Performance-cores.

https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/architecture-and-technology/turbo-boost/turbo-boost-technology.html for more information.

11. Unlocked features are present with select chipsets and processor combinations. Altering clock frequency or voltage may void any product warranties and reduce stability, security, 

performance, and life of the processor and other components. Check with system and component manufacturers for details.

12. Available only on Intel® Core™ processors (14th gen) featuring integrated graphics.
13. Maximum memory speeds are associated with 1 DIMM per Channel (1DPC) configurations. Additional DIMM loading on any channel may impact maximum memory speed. Up to 

DDR5-5600 MT/s 1DPC UDIMM 1Rx8, 1Rx16 and DDR5-5200 1Rx8, 1Rx16, 2Rx8 on select SKUs. Maximum memory capacity is achievable with 2DPC configurations.
