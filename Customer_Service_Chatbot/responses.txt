2. Subject to regional availability, operating system support and router compatibility. Learn more at https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/products/docs/wireless/wi-fi-7.html 
3. On select processor SKUs. DDR5-5600 MT/s 1DPC UDIMM 1Rx8, 1Rx16 (lead supplier) and DDR5-5200 1Rx8, 1Rx16, 2Rx8 are POR on all IntelÂ® Coreâ„¢ i9 desktop processor SKUs, all 

IntelÂ® Coreâ„¢ i7 desktop processor SKUs, and select IntelÂ® Coreâ„¢ i5 desktop processor SKUs (14th gen).

4. Check motherboard vendor for compatible BIOS. 
5.
6. Performance hybrid architecture combines two core microarchitectures, Performance-cores (P-cores) and Efficient-cores (E-cores), on a single processor die first introduced on 

IntelÂ® Coreâ„¢ i5 desktop processors (14th gen), IntelÂ® Coreâ„¢ i7 desktop processors (14th gen), and IntelÂ® Coreâ„¢ i9 desktop processors (14th gen) only.

12th Gen IntelÂ® Coreâ„¢ processors. Select 12th Gen and newer IntelÂ® Coreâ„¢ processors do not have performance hybrid architecture, only P-cores, and have same cache size as prior 
generation. IntelÂ® Coreâ„¢ i3 N-series processors only have E-cores. See ark.intel.com for SKU details.

7. Built into the hardware, IntelÂ® Thread Director is provided only in performance hybrid architecture configurations of 12th Gen or newer IntelÂ® Coreâ„¢ processors; OS enablement is 

required. Available features and functionality vary by OS.

8. Processor cores listed first are the total number of cores in the processor followed by the number of P-cores and E-cores in parentheses (P+E).
9.
10. Efficient-core frequencies are lower to optimize power usage. The frequency of cores and core types varies by workload, power consumption, and other factors. Visit 

IntelÂ® Hyper-Threading Technology, IntelÂ® Turbo Boost Max Technology 3.0, and IntelÂ® Thermal Velocity Boost are only available on Performance-cores.

https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/architecture-and-technology/turbo-boost/turbo-boost-technology.html for more information.

11. Unlocked features are present with select chipsets and processor combinations. Altering clock frequency or voltage may void any product warranties and reduce stability, security, 

performance, and life of the processor and other components. Check with system and component manufacturers for details.

12. Available only on IntelÂ® Coreâ„¢ processors (14th gen) featuring integrated graphics.
13. Maximum memory speeds are associated with 1 DIMM per Channel (1DPC) configurations. Additional DIMM loading on any channel may impact maximum memory speed. Up to 

DDR5-5600 MT/s 1DPC UDIMM 1Rx8, 1Rx16 and DDR5-5200 1Rx8, 1Rx16, 2Rx8 on select SKUs. Maximum memory capacity is achievable with 2DPC configurations.
